Dialist started when someone couldn't remember the name of a restaurant. The number was in their contacts app, but with hundreds of contacts and no name to search by it was essentially impossible to find. Adding infrequently used contacts to the Favorites list would be an easy fix, but it just abuses and bloats the Favorites. Wouldn't it be great if we could have multiple Favorites lists? One for work, one for family, one for takeout, etc.

This is where Dialist comes in. Dialist lets you build multiple lists of contacts, using your phone's existing Contacts. As an added bonus it makes it easy to start a group text thread with some or all the members of a list.

The initial app was built in 2 weeks using SwiftUI. In the couple of weeks that followed, it was refined and tested, and new features were added. It's available today to try for free on the App Store.
